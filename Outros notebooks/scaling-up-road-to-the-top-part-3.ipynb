When we fine tune in this function I also have it calculate and return the TTA predictions on the test set, since later on we'll be ensembling the TTA results of a number of models. Note also that we no longer have `seed=42` in the `ImageDataLoaders` line -- that means we'll have different training and validation sets each time we call this. That's what we'll want for ensembling, since it means that each model will use slightly different data.\n\nThe more important change is that I've added an `accum` argument to implement *gradient accumulation*.

In fastai, the parameter you pass to `GradientAccumulation` defines how many batches of gradients are accumulated. Since we're adding up the gradients over `accum` batches, we therefore need to divide the batch size by that same number. The resulting training loop is nearly mathematically identical to using the original batch size, but the amount of memory used is the same as using a batch size `accum` times smaller!\n\nFor instance, here's a basic example of a single epoch of a training loop without gradient accumulation:\n\n```python\nfor x,y in dl:\n    calc_loss(coeffs, x, y).backward()\n    coeffs.data.sub_(coeffs.grad * lr)\n    coeffs.grad.zero_()\n```\n\nHere's the same thing, but with gradient accumulation added (assuming a target effective batch size of 64):\n\n```python\ncount = 0            # track count of items seen since last weight update\nfor x,y in dl:\n    count += len(x)  # update count based on this minibatch size\n    calc_loss(coeffs, x, y).backward()\n    if count>64:     # count is greater than accumulation target, so do weight update\n        coeffs.data.sub_(coeffs.grad * lr)\n        coeffs.grad.zero_()\n        count=0      # reset count\n```\n\nThe full implementation in fastai is only a few lines of code -- here's the [source code](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/callback/training.py#L26).\n\nTo see the impact of gradient accumulation, consider this small model:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train('convnext_small_in22k', 128, epochs=1, accum=1, finetune=False)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-24T14:07:52.062856Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-24T14:07:52.063802Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-24T14:07:58.279326Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-24T14:07:52.063758Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-24T14:07:58.278365Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.HTML object>","text/html":"\n<style>\n    /* Turns off some styling */\n    progress {\n        /* gets rid of default border in Firefox and Opera. */\n        border: none;\n        /* Needs to be in here for Safari polyfill so background images work as expected. */\n        background-size: auto;\n    }\n    .progress-bar-interrupted, .progress-bar-interrupted::-webkit-progress-bar {\n        background: #F44336;\n    }\n</style>\n"},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"<IPython.core.display.HTML object>","text/html":"<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: left;\">\n      <th>epoch</th>\n      <th>train_loss</th>\n      <th>valid_loss</th>\n      <th>error_rate</th>\n      <th>time</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0.000000</td>\n      <td>0.000000</td>\n      <td>0.000000</td>\n      <td>00:04</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":23},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's create a function to find out how much memory it used, and also to then clear out the memory for the next run:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import gc\ndef report_gpu():\n    print(torch.cuda.list_gpu_processes())\n    gc.collect()\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-24T14:08:00.501286Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-24T14:08:00.502287Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-24T14:08:00.506726Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-24T14:08:00.502236Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-24T14:08:00.505846Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"report_gpu()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-07-24T14:08:01.488058Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-07-24T14:08:01.489011Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-07-24T14:08:01.857408Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-07-24T14:08:01.488975Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-07-24T14:08:01.856432Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"GPU:0\nprocess       2680 uses     5002.000 MB GPU memory\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":25},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So with `accum=1` the GPU used around 5GB RAM.
